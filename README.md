# Hi, I'm Parth ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a software engineer and entrepreneur. Presently, I am pursuing a Master's in [Computer Science](https://dmi.unibas.ch/de/studium/computer-science-informatik/master) at the [University of Basel, Switzerland](https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/About-University.html) focusing on Distributed Systems. My journey is fueled by a deep desire to contribute meaningfully to society through technology and innovation. With a foundation of 4 years at [CERN](https://home.cern) and [internships](https://www.parthshandilya.com/resume#internships) in diverse industries, I've developed a strong skill set in software engineering, which I'm now expanding through advanced studies and filling the knowledge gaps.
