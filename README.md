# Hey, I'm Parth 👋

I'm an AI Engineer building systems that turn messy data into real-world impact — with ownership, clarity, and a collaborative spirit.

- Currently AI/ML Engineer @ [Kadoa](https://kadoa.com) — working on unstructured data extraction.
- Research @ [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch) - exploring how LLM and VLM can make sense of time series data for real-world use.
- MSc Computer Science @ [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch) | [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/About-University.html) | Focus: Machine Intelligence & Distributed Systems
- 4+ years of full-time experience in software and data engineering.
- Learning in public | Writing occasionally
- Always exploring new ideas, from privacy-preserving ML to distributed infrastructure.

> I care about building things that last and learning along the way.
